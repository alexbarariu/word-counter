# Source code for the word counter found at https://nuby.dev/word-counter

To use the file, you must have React & Tailwind initialised in your project.

Please note that there are a few modifications made to the Tailwind config file, where I added 2 custom animations, fade-in & fade-in-up. They aren't necessary, they just add a fade in animation to the components on load/show & may be removed without affecting the site.

For any queries or potential improvements, do not hesitate to contact me at alex@nuby.dev
